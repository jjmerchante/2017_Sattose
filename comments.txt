- Images should be scaled up, labels on x-axis not readable (figure 1,2,3)
- Section 4, probably because it is about work in progress, seems much more immature than the other sections. Also the screen shots are too small to be readable.

- There is an aspect that needs further clarification, that is that there is no discussion on the idiom retrieval process.
- Since the whole reliability of the study is based on how an idiom is identified, I think that it is necessary to provide more details and a discussion about the possible errors and threats.

One reflection about the anti-idioms. Since an anti-idiom is a piece of code that should have been written differently (i.e., with an idiom), I don't think that the parallel with anti-patterns is fitting, as an anti-idiom is the lack of the use of an idiom.

It would be really interesting to see an evaluation of the use of the approach on daily development, maybe with an integration with the IDE, to see the impact on maintainability on a Python project.

- Section 2. provide a brief description of the arguments
